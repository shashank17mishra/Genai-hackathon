# 🧠 Cognitive Quest – Adaptive AI Learning Ecosystem  

**Theme:** EduTech | Personalized Learning & Cognitive Development  
**Hackathon:** GenAI Hackathon 2025  

> *“A living, evolving AI learner that grows with you — not for you.”*

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement  

Traditional online learning systems focus on **content delivery**, not on **how learners think, adapt, and evolve**.  
Existing AI tutors provide one-size-fits-all responses — ignoring each learner’s unique personality, pace, and curiosity.  

As a result, learners face:  
- Cognitive overload from static explanations  
- Lack of motivation due to non-personalized feedback  
- Difficulty tracking real understanding and skill growth  

**We aim to create a system that mirrors how a learner’s mind actually works — adaptive, evolving, and self-improving.**

---

## 💡 Solution Approach  

**Cognitive Quest** redefines personalized learning through an adaptive AI ecosystem that continuously evolves with each learner.  

It integrates **three intelligent subsystems** forming a closed cognitive feedback loop:  

1. **🪞 Cognitive Mirror**  
   - Analyzes the learner’s personality, depth, and comprehension level  
   - Adjusts tone, complexity, and teaching method in real-time  

2. **🧬 Skill Genome (Dynamic Skill Tree)**  
   - A visual, self-growing knowledge map  
   - Expands, merges, or fades based on user progress and curiosity  

3. **🌉 AI Learning Bridge**  
   - Fetches curated learning material (videos, documents, challenges) via Gemini API  
   - Automatically updates mastery level, XP, and confidence score upon completion  

> **Adaptive Loop:**  
> Learner → Cognitive Mirror → AI Bridge → Learning → Genome Update → Mirror Recalibration
